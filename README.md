# 💘 Valentine Vibes

This is not a serious web application.  
This is a **romantic experiment disguised as code**.

Valentine Vibes is a playful one-page Valentine’s Day web experience where the *“No”* button has commitment issues, hearts float freely, and the background softly glows like it knows something you don’t. Built as a vibe-coding project—fast, fun, and intentionally a little unhinged.

Perfect for asking someone out.  
Perfect for embarrassing yourself digitally.  
Worth it either way.

## ✨ What’s Inside

- 💌 A Valentine setup flow that generates a **shareable link**
- 🏃‍♂️ A *very* evasive “No” button with changing excuses
- 💖 Floating hearts because subtlety is overrated
- 🌌 A dreamy aurora background for maximum emotional impact
- 📱 Fully responsive — romance works on mobile too

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack (a.k.a. the Love Language)

- **Vite** — fast builds, no waiting, like love should be
- **React + TypeScript** — feelings, but type-safe
- **Tailwind CSS** — styled with intention
- **shadcn/ui** — clean components, zero drama
- **OGL (WebGL)** — for the ✨ ambience ✨

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Prerequisites:  
You need **Node.js** and **npm** (and ideally emotional availability).

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open your browser and let fate take it from there.

## 📜 Available Scripts

npm run dev      # start local dev server
npm run build    # build for production
npm run preview  # preview production build
npm run lint     # keep things respectable
npm run test     # test your love (and code)

## 🧠 Project Philosophy

This project was built with vibe-coding in mind:

Rapid iteration

Playful UI

Emotional overengineering

Minimal concern for long-term maintainability

Sometimes you don’t need enterprise architecture.
Sometimes you just need a button that refuses rejection.

## ❤️ Credits

Built with help from Lovable AI — thank you for turning chaotic ideas into something shippable and charming.

## 📄 License

MIT — do whatever you want, including stealing this idea to ask someone out.  
No guarantees on the outcome.

If you want:
- a **more sarcastic** version
- a **cuter / softer** version
- or a **“professional README but still funny”** version

say the word and I’ll tune it precisely.  

**Or... you could tune it yourself and actually put some time into this Valentine** 🤷‍♂️
